=========

The purpose of this repository is to create a common place to participate in the creation of a C++ Linux SDK.
This project is in a very initial state, so it is not recommended to use it in production scenarios.

Rules:
 1.- Classes should avoid the use of pointers in functions whenever possible.
 2.- Classes should recreate the behaviour of Java and C# classes. 
 3.- Class names and function names should be self-explanatory.
 4.- Avoid more than two levels of abstraction.
