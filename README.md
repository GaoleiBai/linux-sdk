linux-sdk
=========

The purpose of this repository is to create a common place to participate in the creation of a C++ Linux SDK.

Rules:
 1.- Classes should avoid use pointers in functions whenever possible.
 2.- Classes should recreate the behaviour of Java and C# classes. 
 3.- Exoteric names and operators are forbidden. Class names and function names should be self-explanatory.
 4.- Crazy abstractions are forbidden. Avoid more than two levels of abstraction.
